# KaarTech Repository Template

Default templates for KaarTech repositories, including LICENSE, .reuse/dep5, Code of Conduct, etc. All repositories on github.com/KaarProducts will be created based on this template.

## To-Do

In case you are the maintainer of a new KaarTech project, these are the steps to do with the template files:

- Check if the default license also applies to your project. A license change should only be required in exceptional cases. If this is the case, please change the [license file](LICENSE).
- Adjust the contribution guidelines (e.g. add coding style guidelines, pull request checklists, different license if needed etc.)
- Add information about your project to this README (name, description, requirements etc). Especially take care for the <your-project> placeholders - those ones need to be replaced with your project name. 
- Remove all content in this README above and including the horizontal line ;)
